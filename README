Amalgamation seeks to be an accurate clone of Sid Sackson's classic board game 
"Acquire," originally published by 3M in 1962.  It is essentially a stock market
simulation game in which players purchase shares in one of 7 corporate chains, 
and use tiles to initiate, grow, and merge these chains.

This project will be written in TCL, and will be organized into two components:
a server, designed to respond to standard http requests, and a client, which
will initally be a tcl/tk web client, but may be any client able to
communicate using http.
